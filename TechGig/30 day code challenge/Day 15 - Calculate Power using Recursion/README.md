#Calculate power using Recursion (100 Marks)<br/>
This program takes two integers from user ( base number and a exponent) and calculates the power. Instead of using loops to calculate power, this program uses recursion to calculate the power of a number.<br/>
<br/>
###Input Format<br/>
For this challenge, you need to take 2 integer inputs from stdin which are separated by a single space. <br/>
<br/>
###Constraints<br/>
1 < N < 50<br/>
0 <= P <= 12<br/>

###Output Format<br/>
You will print the answer to the stdout. <br/>
