# Patch Up Two Matrices (100 Marks) <br/>
For this challenge, you need to take 2 matrices as an input from the stdin , add them and print the resultant matrix to the stdout.<br/>
<br/>

### Input Format<br/>
Two matrices to be taken as an input. <br/>
For each matrix, on first line you need to tell that how many rows and columns your matrix need to have and these values should be separated by space. <br/>
Then after that, each line will represent will represent each row and you need to enter numbers which each rows should have separated by a space. <br/>
<br/>

### Constraints<br/>
1 <  (n,m) < 100<br/>
1 <  (p,q) < 100<br/>
<br/>

### Output Format<br/>
Print the resultant matrix to the stdout where each each line should represent <br/>
Note : Please do not include space after the numbers which are in the last column as it will affect your submission and you will not get marks. <br/>
Each row and values in the row should be separated by a space. <br/>


## Explanation<br/>

Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added. The sum of two matrices A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as do A and B. The sum of A and B, denoted A + B, is computed by adding corresponding elements of A and B. <br/>
