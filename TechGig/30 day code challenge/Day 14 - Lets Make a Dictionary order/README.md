###Lets make a dictionary order (100 Marks) <br/>
You need to input N words one on each line and output should be lexicographically sorted i.e the words which comes as a output should be alphabetically sorted <br/>

###Input Format <br/>
You will be taking an integer N from STDIN.<br/>
Following N lines contains string one on each line. <br/>

###Constraints<br/>
1 < N < 10000<br/>
1 < |S| < 1000<br/>


###Output Format<br/>
The words should be lexicographically sorted and should be displayed one per each line.<br/>

##Explanation<br/>
<br/>
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographical product) is a generalization of the way the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. <br/>
